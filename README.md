Using rails console instructions:
  -from your local repo run cap production rails:console
  -follow prompts. You will need to enter the deployment account's password twice. Then you will need to enter your server        account's password. Your server username must be the same as your local username. If you don't have sudo access on your        server account, you will not be able to use the rails console.
